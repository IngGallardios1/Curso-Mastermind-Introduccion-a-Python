- About
In the first module of the Mastermind course on Introduction to Python Programming, we covered the fundamentals of Python programming. We started by exploring the different types of variables in Python and how they can be used in your programs. We then delved into the essential control structures, including if conditional statements and loops, which are the building blocks of many programs.

Throughout the module, we worked on several practical exercises to apply what we learned. By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of the basics of Python programming, and you will be able to write simple programs that use variables, conditionals, and loops. This knowledge is essential for any programmer, and it will set the foundation for the more advanced topics we'll cover in the later modules.
